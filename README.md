# base
A paltform for multipath video transmission.  
And now, this project is full of bugs. And the code implementation is quite awful.   

And shuld point out that, most of the codes here are copied from somewhere else.  

The log module ns3log is from ns3 simulation platform.  
The transmission and congestion mudule id from razor project. (https://github.com/yuanrongxi/razor)  
The rtc_base module is from webrtc project and is exploited here for thread creation and management.  
Thanks for the authors' contribution of these opensource project.  

In total, It seems that I write nothing.
